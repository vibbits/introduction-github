## About this course

This workshop will take you through the basics and a little more on how to use Git and GitHub.
Tighten your sitbelts to enjoying some time-travel analogy to understand how Git works, how you can connect it to GitHub and how this will help you with your version control.
Git is a free and open source distributed version-control system designed to maintain code, track changes, recover old versions and collaborate with other developers.

## Get ready for the course

#### 1. BEFORE THE COURSE 

If you donâ€™t have experience with command line it is ***essential*** that you follow a quick course since this skills are very important to be able to use git and GitHub.

To not get lost during the course start the crash course [***Introduction to Linux command line***](https://elearning.vib.be/courses/linux/) on [VIB e-learnign](https://elearning.vib.be/) system.

#### 2. GET YOUR COMPUTER READY

For this course we are going to use some tools, some are mandatory some are sugestions that we believe can possibly make your experience better and the didatics more simple. You can find the detailes instructions for **any operating system*** in our [Get Ready chapter](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibbits/introduction-github/master/tutorials/1_Get_ready_for_the_course/tutorial.md#1). 

Summary of what you might need:
- WSL with GitBash (for windowns users)
- Git installed in your terminal (MAC & Linux)
- MarkText (Editor Sugestion - MarkDown)
- Ungit (Visualization tool - NOT mandatory)
