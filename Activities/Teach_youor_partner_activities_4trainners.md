## For the trainer

For the "Teach your partner activities" might be interesting if they are taking longer, that some tips can be shared to point them to the right direction. 



During the **Catastrophe** activity, the trainer need to go to each pair, and in one of the computer completely delete the local repository (`rm -rf repo_name`) and in the other, make an absurd commit that they need to get rid of. In this case i usually do `echo "I did a freak commit accident, I need to fix it!" > catastrophe.txt` and I make the commit of this file. 



Before the activity, make sure they have a "clean tree" message after completing the git -github routine `git add` + `git commit -m "msg"` + `git push`, so they can actually recover the previous state and the complete local repository.
